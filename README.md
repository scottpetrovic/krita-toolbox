# ToolKit (Readme for Github)
ToolKit acts as a minimal toolbox to store Krita's tools. It is meant to replace usage of the less customizable default Krita toolbox.

## Install 
Start Krita and go through the main menu Tools -> Scripts -> Import Python Plugin from Web.

Add this URL to import from the web: https://github.com/scottpetrovic/krita-toolbox

Finish installing and restart Krita. You might have to activate it in Configure Krita if it isn't.

## Use
Under the main menu Settings -> Dockers, you should see a 'Tool Kit' Docker now.
Enable ToolKit, and deactivate the original Toolbox Docker.
Click the associated toolbutton to activate the tool, press and hold to open the subtools menu.
Click or drag onto the subtool to select.
Right click to be amazed with options.

## Uninstall
Go to the main menu Settings > Manage Resources. Click "Open Resources folder". Go inside the pykrita folder. Then delete the "toolkitdocker" folder and the toolkitdocker.desktop file.
