# ToolKit (Readme shown in Krita)
#### ToolKit acts as a minimal toolbox to store Krita's tools.
## Start
Once you have the .zip file, in Krita go to Tools -> Scripts -> Import Python Plugin.
Follow the guides, and restart Krita.
Under Settings -> Dockers, you should see a 'Tool Kit' Docker.
Activate this, and deactivate the original Toolbox Docker.
## Use
Click the associated toolbutton to activate the tool, press and hold to open the subtools menu.
Click or drag onto the subtool to select.
## Feedback
